<!-- Project 1: Secure Small Office Network -->
<div class="project">
  <h3>Secure Small Office Network – Blue Team Lab</h3>
  <p>
    A beginner-friendly Cisco Packet Tracer lab where I built a small office network and practiced blue team skills:
    VLAN segmentation, ACLs for traffic control, and switch port security to prevent unauthorized access.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Separated users into VLANs (Admin, Employee, Guest)</li>
    <li>Configured inter-VLAN routing with a router-on-a-stick</li>
    <li>Applied ACLs to block guest access to admin PCs</li>
    <li>Enabled port security to prevent rogue devices</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Project 2: Zendesk Simulated Help Desk -->
<div class="project">
  <h3>Zendesk Simulated Help Desk – IT Support Practice</h3>
  <p>
    A hands-on simulated help desk environment where I managed and resolved IT support tickets using Zendesk:
    creating, triaging, and documenting tickets while communicating with end users professionally.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Handled incidents, service requests, and user questions</li>
    <li>Documented troubleshooting steps in internal notes</li>
    <li>Managed ticket priorities and statuses for workflow efficiency</li>
    <li>Practiced end-user communication with clear, professional responses</li>

<!-- Project 3: Python Command Line Math & Security Program -->
<div class="project">
  <h3>Python Command Line Math & Security Program</h3>
  <p>
    A menu-driven Python program that demonstrates math and security concepts. Users can generate secure passwords, calculate percentages, find days until a target date, solve triangles using the law of cosines, and compute cylinder volumes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Menu-driven program with input validation for smooth user experience</li>
    <li>Secure password generation using Python's <code>secrets</code> and <code>string</code> modules</li>
    <li>Practical math applications: percentages, law of cosines, cylinder volume</li>
    <li>Date calculations with the <code>datetime</code> module</li>
  </ul>
