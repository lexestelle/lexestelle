<!-- Project 1: Secure Small Office Network -->
<div class="project">
  <h3>Secure Small Office Network – Blue Team Lab</h3>
  <p>
    A beginner-friendly Cisco Packet Tracer lab where I built a small office network and practiced blue team skills:
    VLAN segmentation, ACLs for traffic control, and switch port security to prevent unauthorized access.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Separated users into VLANs (Admin, Employee, Guest)</li>
    <li>Configured inter-VLAN routing with a router-on-a-stick</li>
    <li>Applied ACLs to block guest access to admin PCs</li>
    <li>Enabled port security to prevent rogue devices</li>
  </ul>
